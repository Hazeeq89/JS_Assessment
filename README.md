# JS_Assessment
1) What did you like about this project?
It was challenging and required me to review certain concepts therefore allowing me to understand the concept better.


2) What did you struggle with in this project?
I struggled with the control flow conditional statement. Started coding in if else but realized it was too repetitive therefore decided to go with switch case as there was only one variable to be compared with.
